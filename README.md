# DFA-Minimizer
A tool that minimizes deterministic finite automata with a visual interactive graph
start drawing and minimizing DFAs!

**Adding States**
Type in "new label" input the name of the state e.g: "S1" then **double click** anywhere on the canvas to add that state.

**Adding Edges**
Type in "new label" input the name of the input e.g: "1", **double click** on the source state, then **double click** on the target state.
